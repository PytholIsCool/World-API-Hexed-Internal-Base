## A basic VRChat mod to kickstart your development.

*Small disclaimer: None of this is my code. This is Umbra's template mod with World/Starborn API pre-installed.*
*Also, I haven't provided examples for everything. Just a few basic things such as toggles, regular buttons, duo buttons, sliders, etc.*
